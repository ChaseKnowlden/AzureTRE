# Bootstrapping

This document covers the steps that have to be executed manually before Azure TRE can be deployed using CI/CD.

## Login to Azure

Run `login` command and select the Azure subscription you wish to deploy Azure TRE to:

```cmd
az login
az account list
az account set --subscription <subscription ID>
```

> **Note:** When running locally the credentials of the logged-in user will be used to deploy the infrastructure. Hence, it is essential that the user has enough permissions to deploy all resources.

See [Sign in with Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli) for more details.

## Create service principals

A service principal needs to be created to authorize CI/CD workflows to provision resources for the TRE workspaces and workspace services.

1. Create a main service principal with "**Owner**" role:

    ```cmd
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "sp-aztre-core" --role Owner --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription_id> --sdk-auth
    ```

1. Save the JSON output

    * Locally - as you will need it later.
    * Create a [GitHub secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) called `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` with the JSON output.

## Create app registrations

Create app registrations for auth based on the [Authentication & authorization](./auth.md) guide.
