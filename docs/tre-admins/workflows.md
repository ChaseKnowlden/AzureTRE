# GitHub Actions workflows (CI/CD)

## Setup instructions

These are onetime configuration steps required to set up the GitHub Actions workflows (pipelines). After the steps the TRE deployment workflow (`/.github/workflows/deploy_tre.yml`) is ready to run.

1. Create service principal and set their [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) as explained in [Bootstrapping](bootstrapping.md#create-service-principals)
1. Create app registrations for auth based on the [Authentication & authorization](auth.md) guide
1. Set other repository secrets as explained in the table below

*Required repository secrets for the CI/CD.*

| <div style="width: 230px">Secret name</div> | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` | Explained in [Bootstrapping - Create service principals](bootstrapping.md#create-service-principals). Main service principal credentials output. |
| `TF_STATE_CONTAINER` | The name of the blob container to hold the Terraform state. By convention the value is `tfstate`. |
| `MGMT_RESOURCE_GROUP` | The name of the shared resource group for all Azure TRE core resources. |
| `STATE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` | The name of the storage account to hold the Terraform state and other deployment artifacts. E.g. `mystorageaccount`. |
| `LOCATION` | The Azure location (region) for all resources. E.g. `westeurope` |
| `ACR_NAME` | A globally unique name for the Azure Container Registry (ACR) that will be created to store deployment images. |
| `PORTER_OUTPUT_CONTAINER_NAME` | The name of the storage container where to store the workspace/workspace service deployment output. Workspaces and workspace templates are implemented using [Porter](https://porter.sh) bundles - hence the name of the secret. The storage account used is the same as defined by `STATE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`. |
| `TRE_ID` | A globally unique identifier. `TRE_ID` can be found in the resource names of the Azure TRE instance; for example, a `TRE_ID` of `tre-dev-42` will result in a resource group name for Azure TRE instance of `rg-tre-dev-42`. This must be less than 12 characters. Allowed characters: Alphanumeric, underscores, and hyphens. |
| `CORE_ADDRESS_SPACE` |  The address space for the Azure TRE core virtual network. E.g. `10.1.0.0/22`. Recommended `/22` or larger.  |
| `TRE_ADDRESS_SPACE` | The address space for the whole TRE environment virtual network where workspaces networks will be created (can include the core network as well). E.g. `10.0.0.0/12`|
| `SWAGGER_UI_CLIENT_ID` | The application (client) ID of the [TRE Swagger UI](auth.md#tre-swagger-ui) service principal. |
| `AAD_TENANT_ID` | The tenant ID of the Azure AD. |
| `API_CLIENT_ID` | The application (client) ID of the [TRE API](auth.md#tre-api) service principal. |
| `API_CLIENT_SECRET` | The application password (client secret) of the [TRE API](auth.md#tre-api) service principal. |
| `DEPLOY_GITEA` | If set to `false` disables deployment of the Gitea shared service. |
| `DEPLOY_NEXUS` | If set to `false` disables deployment of the Nexus shared service. |
| `TEST_APP_ID` | The application (client) ID of the [E2E Test app](auth.md#tre-e2e-test) service principal. |
| `TEST_USER_NAME` | The username of the [E2E Test User](auth.md#end-to-end-test-user). |
| `TEST_USER_PASSWORD` | The password of the [E2E Test User](auth.md#end-to-end-test-user). |
| `TEST_WORKSPACE_APP_ID` | The application (client) ID of the [Workspaces app](auth.md#workspaces) service principal. |

## Pull request security

Many of the workflows access [GitHub repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) and malicious code in workflows pose a security risk. Thus, pull requests (PRs) from forks cannot be allowed to execute workflows freely. By default, workflows are not run by pull requests from forks, but can be enabled with [`pull_request_target` event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target).

However, changes reviewed and found safe should be able to execute workflows. A label, that can only be assigned by authorized project members, can be used to safeguard workflow execution:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [labeled]
    branches: [develop]

jobs:
  my_job:
    if: |
      github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository
      || contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'safe to test')
```

The snippet above contains two conditions:

1. Checking the name of the originating repository of the PR. In case the PR is from a fork the condition evaluates to `false`. `github.repository` (see [`github` context](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context)) evaluates into string e.g., "microsoft/AzureTRE".
2. Checking if the pull request has a label "safe to test".

Effectively, the two conditions allow the job execution for all PRs originating from internal branches, but only allow PRs originating from a fork with "safe to test" label assigned to do so. The workflows of fork PRs will remain in "skipped" state until the label is set.

!!! caution
    Any job **without** the condition is allowed to execute even if the PR originates from a fork.
